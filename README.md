## 📜 About

**GrowASnake | REMAKE** is a solo-developed take on retro snake gameplay, rebuilt from scratch using the Godot Engine. While visually minimal and intentionally simple, the game introduces fresh rules and hazards compared to older versions.

Key differences include:

- Apple types that can heal or harm
- Bombs and other player-hostile hazards
- Gradually increasing difficulty over time
- Altered mechanics that go beyond the traditional grid-and-turn logic

This is not a clone. It’s a standalone creation that reinterprets old-school mechanics from a personal, creative lens.
